I drink that","Volcom? I wear that","DA5H Records? I listen to that","'Cuz everything can be right as rain","When you listen to the dragonfly","You don't have to smile","And even if you cry","There's still a heart inside","And It might not get much easier","Still I come out each time much stronger, oh","'Cuz the music never stops, little canary","This world you paint by what you feel","To love yourself under the weight that you carry","Is a magic you have in a digital flower field","And even if your heart's in the right place","Sometimes the answer is a greater change","Get comfy, but don't wait","Your target's in range","In a digital flower field","There's a place in your mind, where every dream resides","Let it out, scream and shout, it's your own damn life","Can't change those marks, but you can change your sight","With hearts as strong as horses, we'll walk on through the night","And It might not get much easier","Still I come out each time much stronger, oh","'Cuz the music never stops, little canary","This world you paint by what you feel","To love yourself under the weight that you carry","Yeah! Yeah! Let me hear ya! Let me hear ya!","'Cuz the music never stops, little canary","This world you paint by what you feel","To love yourself under the weight that you carry","Is a magic you have in a digital flower field"],"acronyms":["adff","dff"],"coverArtAttribution":"Lemoocado","length":248.21551}
