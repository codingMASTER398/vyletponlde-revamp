Step right up! My little ponies, your childhood bestowed you your wings. Your memories serve more than fond keepsakes. Awaiting you in this very hall is the memento of all mementos. ","The dusk of your visage, with a mind of its own? ","That’s right! ","In this very place, you will learn to speak to your shadow.","Your faithful companion, trailing in your stead at all times, endowed a new life, saturated in the light that left you.","Should your brave little shadow respond to you, what do you think it will say? ","It has known all your feelings and seen all your days. Aren’t you excited? Draw from the innovations of antiquity. ","With your shadow, become all which trailed before you!","After all, it’s never left your side.","Just sit back and relax.","It’s your destiny, after all!","You’re listening to 32.7 The Creek","Just Classics","Aren’t you excited?","Aren’t you excited?","Put your hooves together","Because you’re riding the carousel","And listening to","From the heart of Ponyville","Spinning our next track","The one and only DJ Pon3","Let’s spin this shit"],"acronyms":["htttys","htttys"]}
