    "We once ruled the world",
    "Detained by our love",
    "Oh Lord, why’d you go",
    "Leaving me here all alone?",
    "Hearth’s Warming Eve is tonight",
    "But you left me to die",
    "Even though the sun may come up to shine through another day",
    "It’ll never ever be the same",
    "A fallacy is just another word for a life gone wrong",
    "It’s a fantasy in a world of its own",
    "Lights may surround the end of the scene",
    "But nopony’s gonna stop us it’s our biggest dream",

    "Even though, even though",
    "Even though the darkness found us",
    "Holding us to shame"
